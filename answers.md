1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    An adaptive design checks what size your screen is and delivers content specifically for that type of screen. This is super nice for mobile users, because it takes up less data, but painful for designers and developers who have to plan out a ton of different screen sizes and deliver the right content. Adaptive designs just scale based on how big your viewport is and use breakouts to change the design up as they go. They deliver all the information, however. 

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Desktop first vs mobile first refers to which version of the website you develop first. The mobile site is smaller and less flashy, but it's honestly the site that is going to hit the most users, so it's the one you should develop first. However, most bosses are going to have you develop the desktop site first. 

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

    Setting font-size to 62.5% divides most default browser's default text size down to 10px, allowing us to more easily convert to rems. Now the rem to pixel conversion is just multiplying by 10, so 1.6rem is 16px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    Preprocessing allows you to write your CSS slightly differently, and a compiler will convert everything back to CSS the browser can read. This allows you to write more legible code, and allows the preprocessor to add functionality, like variables and functions. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

    Nesting is easily the best concept. Having code that's actually legible is invaluable to anyone working in a team or anyone who intends to come back to their code in the future. I honestly haven't had any trouble with any of the concepts because I've coded in Javascript before, so it's all fairly similar. Object-oriented thinking isn't something that bothers me.
